                <h3>It's a ... musical!</h3>
                <span class="date">02/23/2026</span>
                <p>Reading about Gas Town and OpenClaw and Moltbook made me realize that I have not been up to date with the latest developments of AI coding agents. All this talk about orchestrating swarms of agents into hierarchies of workers that would take on anything. I felt like i gotta do some catching up. I not have the greatest interest in personal assistants that take over my banking or shopping or writing my emails for me. I will be able to do that on my own - for now. I am interested though in an agent that is writing code for me.  And I believe a lot of people's judgement as well as my own judgement, that they are pretty good at it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Having this (admittedly not very complex: its all static) website created for me within very little time and having it look pretty neat and having saved myself from having headaches form dealing with CSS, I gotta say: I am impressed. People have been talking big words about the changes these LLMs will bring into many jobs. A lot of it was hype. But what is beings said about the agents: I am going to listen to and start using them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When the chatbots came around and delivered code the gain in productivity was debatable. With the coding agents it is not debateable. They write working code very quickly. Even though they do not produce good software all by themselves. I will start using them. And see where they take me. I am pretty sure that understanding the systems that you build will stay crucial and necessary. That is why I am happy to get the very formal education at university, studying my Computer Science as I go along.</p>

                <h3>It's a ... Follow up!</h3>
                <span class="date">02/23/2026</span>
                <p>I forgot where Rainald Goetz said it, but I liked it: The majority of writing is bad. He was talking about literature. What an author can produce, how 99% of your (my) writing is bad. On work that the text needs. Which surely is a critique on bad pieces of text, but it is also an encouragement. You gotta write more! I will leave this just here, just as I will leave this first "article" I wrote (the one about the musical), just here. For the start. I did not write in a long time and I will need to write a lot more.</p>
