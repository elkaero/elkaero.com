* Debian Web Server

** Going through the securing Debian tutorial
[[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch02.en.html#idm287]]


*** What to do with server?
- host website
- host other small services that i create myself

-> deinstall unneeded things/services
-> or add stuff

- users and permissions

ok, i read a bit and now i am getting exhausted.
actually  wanna use my system,
not... stop while configurating

** using a different approach
okay got the page up by:
1. installing appache2
2. allowing up Apache Full in ufw
3. enabling the site with a2ensite
4. pointing the A record in namecheap to the public IP
5. got a https certificate with certbot

   works.


** now make the machine write me some nice website.
This will be the actual Lastenbuch part:
